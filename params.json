{"tagline":"A Sentry extension which integrates with Bitbucket.","body":"## sentry-bitbucket\r\n\r\nAn extension for Sentry which integrates with Bitbucket. Specifically, it allows you to easily create issues from events within Sentry.\r\n\r\nThis is largely a port of the [sentry-github](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-github) package, with some changes to integrate better with the Bitbucket API.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the package via ``pip``\r\n\r\n    $ pip install sentry-bitbucket\r\n\r\nEnsure you've configured Bitbucket auth in Sentry by adding the following to your ``sentry.conf.py``\r\n\r\n    # Bitbucket needs to be included as a valid auth provider\r\n    SENTRY_AUTH_PROVIDERS = {\r\n        'twitter': ('TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY', 'TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET'),\r\n        'facebook': ('FACEBOOK_APP_ID', 'FACEBOOK_API_SECRET'),\r\n        'github': ('GITHUB_APP_ID', 'GITHUB_API_SECRET'),\r\n        'google': ('GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID', 'GOOGLE_OAUTH2_CLIENT_SECRET'),\r\n        'trello': ('TRELLO_API_KEY', 'TRELLO_API_SECRET'),\r\n        'bitbucket': ('BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_KEY', 'BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_SECRET'),\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    # https://bitbucket.org/account/user/<username>/api\r\n    BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_KEY = ''\r\n    BITBUCKET_CONSUMER_SECRET = ''\r\n\r\nAssociate your account with Bitbucket (if you haven't already) via Account -> Identities.\r\n\r\nYou'll now see a new action on groups which allows quick creation of Bitbucket issues.\r\n\r\n## Caveats\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple Bitbucket identities associated in Sentry, the plugin will just select\r\none to use.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
